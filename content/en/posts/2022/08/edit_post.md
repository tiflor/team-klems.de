The hugo theme PaperMod which I use for this site, has a nice function to [editPost](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/Features#edit-link-for-posts) which adds a kind of edit button on each page which leads to the source of the page to quickly fix and change the page content.
If really like this feature but I was kind of unable to use it in the right way from the beginning.
This post is now used to figure out a working solution.
