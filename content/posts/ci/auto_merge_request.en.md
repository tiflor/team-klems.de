Have you ever forget to create a merge request for your new branch?

Ever search for the work off somebody else in a branch where you unsure if it is ready or worked on?

Are you run GitOps and need to promote your environment through different branches?

Let's create the merge request with GitLab-CI.

## Preparation

To start we need to prepare the repository, we need to have a GitLab access token with api access and the role necessary, mostly developer, to create the merge request.
This token then needs to be available in GitLab CI variable which can be easiest done with glab.
The name of the variable is `MR_TOKEN`, the token itself has to be pasted into the command.

```bash
glab variable set MR_TOKEN <Put your token here>  -m
```

## The CI job
