For some time now, I am listening to a bunch of podcasts. Mostly on my way to or from work.
Often I am ask which podcast I am listing and which I do like to answer this questions I will try to gather some here.

There will also be a Category [Podcast](/en/categories/podcasts/) where all post should be found.
